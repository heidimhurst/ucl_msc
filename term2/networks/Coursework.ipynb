Armed with GPS-enabled Garmin and Apple watches and shoe-embedded sensors, runners can track in real time everything from pace to heart rate to foot strike angle.  A myriad of apps and websites exist to help them analyze this data: MapMyRun, Strava, MyFitnessPal, etc. Many of these tools help runners discover routes through crowd-sourced databases or randomly generating routes of a given length from a user-specified start point.  Given the proliferation of GPS-enabled fitness services, it is no wonder that a number of patents have been filed for route suggestion engines [1; 2; 3].\n",

    "    - Cul-de-sacs and other dead ends are avoided, no matter how long they are.  While this does exclude viable routes where the dead end path could provide a long out-and-back, it avoids short (and annoying) additions.

    "#### Map Matching\n",
    "_Map matching_ is the process of snapping location points obtained through GPS to a road segments.  For our application, this is crucial: it allows traversed OSM road segments to be identified from GPX files.  However, this is a challenging task.  A single GPS point may be located on a road segment, equidistant from two or more segments, or not sufficiently close to any existing segment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the challenge of matching GPX points to road networks, engineers at Microsoft developed the ST Matching algorithm [6].   This has been incorporated into the Open Source Routing Machine API, an open source project dedicated to making routing and location information available [7].  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, map matching is implemented in [`osmnx/gpx.py`](https://github.com/heidimhurst/osmnx/blob/master/osmnx/gpx.py), which parses GPX tracks using Python package `gpx-py` [8].  These parsed tracks may be passed through Open Source Routing Machine API to get OSM Node IDs.  Once GPX tracks have been matched to OSM road segments, each segment is assigned a frequency attribute based on how often it has been traversed (see [`osmnx/gpx.py:`267](https://github.com/heidimhurst/osmnx/blob/master/osmnx/gpx.py#L267)).  This attribute is used in the route generation algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The cells below read in a folder of GPX tracks, convert them to a dictionary of traversed paths, and return that dictionary.  The parameter `npoints` refers to the number of points per track that are fed into the API.  If `npoints` exceeds the number of points in the track, the points are uniformly sampled.  Values between 100-400 seem to return reasonable results."

Following the approach taken by Leigh M. Chinitz [1], route generation is broken into two phases: outbound routing and inbound routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both phases use a greedy heuristic to determine which edge to take next from a given node.  From the current node (or starting node), the algorithm evaluates the 'suitability' of each adjacent edge based on their properties, such as length, bearing/orientation, and frequency of traversal.  These suitability scores are stored in a vector of length equal to the number of evaluated nodes.  They are then normalized such that all scores add to one and an edge is chosen at random with probability corresponding to the normalized suitability score.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Outbound Phase\n",

    "Each of these values is scaled between 1-10 and given an importance weighting.  These are then multiplied and summed, providing a ranking between 1 and 10 per edge considered.

    "## Discussion\n",
    "As demonstrated above, the algorithm created in this coursework is capable of creating random running routes given particular priorities.  Implemented as modules within the OSMnx library, this algorithm takes advantage of open source software to model, compute, and render routes of arbitrary length.  We discuss bugs, runner experience fixes, and potential improvements to the work herein presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of bugs remain within the code:\n",
    "- Map matching of GPX tracks occasionally fails due to miscommunication with the server.  \n",
    "- Map matched edges may or may not be present in the simplified graph used for routing, leading to incorrect estimates of which road segments have been traversed.\n",
    "- One common error is ` `, indicating that no edges exist from which to choose.  This typically occurs when a route accidently heads down an improperly simplified dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of improvements can be made to improve runner experience, or how high of quality runners percieve these routes to be:\n",
    "- Eliminate complicated intersection crossings, perhaps using the the OSMnx `clean_intersections` functionality.\n",
    "- Eliminate self-crossing of routes, which can be disorienting for some runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these improvements, the core of the route creation algorithm would benefit from increased mathematical rigor.  While a simple greedy heuristic using a weighted average is a sufficient starting point for this prototype, a more sophisticated mathematical model taking into account multiple areas of the graph as well as past behavior would lend rigor to this interesting problem.  Future improvements should also focus on runtime reduction, with the objective of achieving near real-time in-brower speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I believe developers who benefit from open source software have an obligation to give back to the community.  Many of the functions developed as part of this project could, with additional bug-fixes, be incorporated back into the core OSMnx package."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "As runners and other exercise enthusiasts continue to collect data, companies such as Strava and MapMyRun will race to extract insight and provide value back to users from this data.  In this field, novel exercise route generation is an exciting and potentially lucrative computational networks problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has demonstrated a basic prototype for creating such routes based on the open source Python package OSMnx, including map matching of GPX tracks to derive frequency information.  Future implementations of this project could aim to reduce bug fixes, improve performance, increase route quality, and contribute back to the open source community."

    "```\n",
    "Install OSMnx from scratch in a brand new virtual environment using Conda. Installation using the Conda Forge package ensures that correct dependencies are all installed as well.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --override-channels -c conda-forge -n OSMNX python=3 osmnx\n",
    "```\n",
    "Activate the virtual environment, and overwrite the original OSMnx package with the downloaded version of my code.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source activate OSMNX\n",
    "pip install -e ~/{path_to_downloaded_fork}/osmnx\n",
    "```\n",
