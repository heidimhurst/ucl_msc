## Term 1
Term 1 focused on building the foundations of geospatial analysis.  This included the following courses:

### GIS Principles of Spatial Analysis ([GEOGG0125](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/study/graduate-taught/msc-modules/geogg125))
Focused on statistical methods and learning the software package R.

Coursework included analyzing the London housing market ([pdf](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_psa/bearma.pdf), [r code](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_psa/bearmaneda.r)) and the presence of eating disorder risk factors among 15-year-old girls in London ([pdf](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_psa/mirco.pdf), [r code](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_psa/mirco.r)).

### GIS Principles and Technology ([CEGEG082](https://sp.cege.ucl.ac.uk/study/Pages/Module-Guide.aspx?ModileCd=CEGEG082))
Focused on exploratory data analysis, especially in Python.

Coursework included implementation of an object-oriented point-in-polygon algorithm in Python ([code](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_pt/coursework/Hurst_GISPT.py), [interactive example](https://heidimhurst.github.io/assets/html/PIP_visualization_w+.html)).

### Representations, Structures, and Algorithms ([GEOGG0126](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/study/graduate-taught/msc-modules/geogg126))
Focused on funamental algorithms and structures underpinning contemporary GIS technology, such as rasters and vectors and topological functions.

Coursework included literature review of multi-observer siting methods and a comparitive analysis of both Delaunay triantulation and Douglas-Peucker line simplification in ArcGIS and QGIS ([pdf](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/gis_rsa/RSA_coursework.pdf)).


### Mapping Science ([CEGEG034](https://sp.cege.ucl.ac.uk/study/Pages/Module-Guide.aspx?ModileCd=CEGEG034))
Focused on fundamentals of mapping, including projections, cartography, basic GNSS...

Coursework included analysis of bank and flood height for Arun River ([pdf](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/mapping_science/term1/tutorial2/tutorial2.pdf), [iPython](https://github.com/heidimhurst/ucl_msc/blob/master/term1/mapping_science/tutorial2/Arun%20River%20Flooding.ipynb)).
